# PROTOKOL (governance influencers)

Definition: "PROTOKOL" is a portmanteau of protocol and KOL (key opinion leader), the latter term is interchangeable with influencer.
Here we wanted to see who are the crypto KOLs in governance, i.e., who has the most influence. This can be measured in many ways: vote weight, successful proposals, the total number of forum posts, etc. Ultimately we went with total votes delegated * token price, which at best shows who has the most aggregate vote weight and at worse is utterly meaningless.


## TODOs
* Update the IA of the key from a modal to a persistent card on the side
* add protocol overviews on the side (1 card per protocol)
* Create individual profiles where users can look up specific addresses + integrate into the link.

## Footnotes

* How to fix TWITTER_WORKER_URL to work most of the time?
