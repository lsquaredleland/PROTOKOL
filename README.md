## Footnotes

* Remember to re-integrate social features "allIdenties" in `fetchDelegatesFromClient`, etc...
* Remember to update .env file -> don't reuse sybil's endpoint
* How to fix TWITTER_WORKER_URL to work most of the time?


* Did overuse Context -> lot of data could probably have just been a hook especially if it's only used in 1 place...
